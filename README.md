Git information As Plain Source

We want to know:

* Current branch name (or sha1 if detached).
* Last commit
    * Who (full name GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, email GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL)
    * When (GIT_AUTHOR_DATE)
    * What (message)

(from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables)

Anything else needs to be on a "are you sure this is needed?" basis.
